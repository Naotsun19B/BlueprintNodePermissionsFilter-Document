# BlueprintNodePermissionsFilter-Document
This plugin adds the feature to manage the nodes displayed in the blueprint editor's action menu (right-click context menu) for each group such as job type.\r\nFor example, you can hide engine standard nodes with high processing load from team members and force them to use lightweight nodes that you have implemented yourself.
